Here is my project for unit 4. It is a simple game using Object Oriented Programming, where the user is given a random phrase, and needs to guess it by choosing a letter, either using the keyboard on their computer or the keyboard buttons on the screens. I also made various changes to the CSS file to personalize my game. I changed the following classes:

- the .show class background-color
- the .chosen class background-color
- the .wrong class background-color
- the .start class background-color
- the .lose class background-color
- the transition time when the user chooses a key from 0.2s to 0.8s

I am going for an 'Exceeds Expectations' grade so that's why I have included the style changes as well as the 'keyup' event listener.

Thanks!
